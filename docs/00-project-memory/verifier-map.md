# Verifier Map

Purpose: Project-specific map from task types to required checks and evidence.
Read when: Defining or reviewing the verifier for an active task.
Skip when: The active task already has a complete verifier.

## Default Checks

- Code:
- Frontend:
- Backend/API:
- Docs/skills:
- Recovery:
- Release:
- Security/high risk:

## Required Evidence

- Command output summary:
- Manual inspection:
- Screenshot or artifact:
- Remaining risk:

## False-Pass Guards

- Do not report skipped checks as passed.
- Do not delete or weaken failing checks without recording why.
- Do not treat mocks as real integration evidence.
- Do not mark high-risk tasks done without confirmation and rollback notes.
